Me (9/8/2018, 5:42:55 PM): there is usually a spinning circle icon below the DELL logo but that isn't showing anymore....I have left it at the startup logo for over an hour and there is no indication that it is going to boot to windows 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:43:11 PM): From what I understand, the issue with your system is it does not complete POST. Is that correct? 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:43:17 PM): correct

Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:45:49 PM): In order to identify and isolate the issue accurately, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your system. 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:46:08 PM): alright, ask away 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:46:49 PM): Have you tried running ePSA test to examine if there is any hardware fauilure like hard drive? 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:47:14 PM): not sure how I would do that test 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:48:11 PM): I will share the steps with you. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:48:16 PM): Steps to perform Pre-Boot System Assessment (PSA) 

 A. Please turn off the computer. Press and hold the <Fn> key on your keyboard and press the power button to power the computer on. Then release both buttons. 
 B. The PSA diagnostics sequence begins. Please take note of any Error-Codes & Validation-Codes it may generate. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:48:31 PM): Please perform the test and help me with the results. 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:50:02 PM): I do not get past the DELL logo 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:52:03 PM): Thank you for the details. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:52:46 PM): Does the system stuck at Dell logo? 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:53:08 PM): Yes 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:54:19 PM): Please Check if the diagnostic code indicated by the beeps from the system. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:54:23 PM): When you switch on your computer, the basic input/output system (BIOS) first detects the internal hardware configuration. It then performs the power-on-self-test (POST). The POST executes several diagnostics tests that check the basic functionality of the system board, CPU, Power Supply Unit, RAM, I/O Bus Controller, keyboard, and video components. If the POST detects any problems the power button will flash or the system will provide an beep code.  The pattern is 1 to 7 flashes or beeps followed by a short pause, then it repeats. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:54:35 PM): I will share an example with you. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:54:36 PM): Example: Flash/Beep code 2 would be presented by 2 flashes or beeps, short pause, and 2 flashes or beeps again.  The system will continue this pattern until the computer is turned off. 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:55:23 PM): Nothing is beeping or flashing 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:57:10 PM): I hope there is no external peripheral devices connected to the system. 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:57:13 PM): Am I right? 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:57:48 PM): That is correct 
Sushant S (9/8/2018, 5:58:54 PM): Based on the symptoms & troubleshooting results, it is evident that components internal to your system need to be replaced. Since your system has Return-to-Depot warranty, it needs to be sent to our Repair Center and the turn-around-time for the repair process would be 7-10 Business days. Let me set it up for you, Okay? 
Me (9/8/2018, 5:59:19 PM): Okay
